üìù Step by step

`#!/bin/bash` ‚Üí Shebang, tells the system to use Bash.

`colors=("red" "green" "blue")` ‚Üí Declares an array named colors with 3 elements: "red", "green"
"blue".

`for color in "${colors[@]}" `‚Üí A for loop that goes through each element in the
array.

`${colors[@]}` expands to all elements of the array. Each time, the variable color takes one value (red, then green, then blue).

`do ... done` ‚Üí Loop body. Inside it, we run:
```bash
echo "Color: $color"
```
Which prints each color with the prefix "Color:".

## Extra Questions
#### What is the purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script? 
That line is called a shebang ( #! ).

üëâ Purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script:

It tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the script. Here, /bin/bash means the script should be executed with the Bash shell.

Without it, the script might run with another default shell (like sh or dash), which can cause errors if your script uses Bash-specific features.

#### How to make a script executable?
1. Save the script.
2. Open a terminal in that directory.
3. Run this command:
chmod = change file permissions
+x = add "execute" permission
4. Now you can run it as:
